# Handling Unbalanced Dataset using SMOTE
## Data:
Please download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
## Description
Handling unbalanced data using SMOTE techique.
Unbalanced data can cause your model to produce unsatisfactory results when they are generalized. There are various techniques to impute dataset like undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE, MSMOTE, bagging based techniques and boosting based techniques.
In this notebook I have used a simple and effective technique,Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE), to impute my unbalanced dataset. I have shown the results of using different metrics such as: Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1-Score and also plotted ROC curves before and after using the SMOTE technique to clearly ditinguish the results.
